Source code used to simulate and evaluate the Fenceless Grazing System's capabilities.

Each folder represents a different figure in the finished thesis. Each folder holds the code necessary to run simulations and evaluate results for each figure. The C++ file is the NS3 simulation, and fenceless.py runs the series of simulations and saves each result into a folder in the home directory. Lastly, each folder holds a script titled analyze.py, which will take the simulation results and build the graphs displayed in the thesis.
